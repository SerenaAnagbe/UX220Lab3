        <p>The life of a teenage girl who never left her home. This movie is about a teenage girl who never had the
            opportunity to leave her house. She lived a very restricted life with daily health routines to ensure she
            was safe and was not in contact with any bacteria.</p>
        <p>After meeting and building a relationship with a neighbor that newly moved into the neighborhood, she was
            inspired by love to be braver and explore the outside world for the first time since she was a baby.</p>
        <p>Over time, she realized that her mum had been lying to her about having a health condition that required her
            to stay indoors all the time because of her fear of losing another family member after the death of her
            husband.</p>
